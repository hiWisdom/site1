Unfortunately, this often requires significant time, effort, and resources spent on marketing and self-promotion, making it hard to achieve premium pay. This deficiency can lead to inconsistent client flow, reduced revenue, and hindered business growth. As a tech product portfolio company of Heelheid Business, Amica addresses this issue, providing a dedicated hub for consultants and coaches to connect with their right-fit clients, solve specific problems, and grow their businesses with ease and efficiency.`,
